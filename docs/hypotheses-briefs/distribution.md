# Distribution Hypotheses

The right distribution and pricing strategies are as critical to success as the
solution itself. They ensure that your offering reaches the right people in the
right way, a notion deeply rooted in the principles set forth in "The Four Steps
to the Epiphany."

## Distribution Channel

A distribution channel is the route through which a solution travels from the
producer to the end-user. It is important to define and describe the chosen
method—be it direct sales, e-commerce, partnerships, or brick-and-mortar
retail—to ensure that the solution is accessible where and when customers need
it.

   or message?

   our choice of distribution?

resonate with how your target customers prefer to learn about and engage with
new offerings.

customers along the journey, from awareness to consideration to purchase.

   creation?

   community and belonging?

Awareness is often the first step in a customer's discovery of a service or
solution. Understanding the preferences and habits of the market can direct your
communication efforts effectively.

   information?

## Influencers

Identifying key influencers—those who sway public opinion or shape industry
trends—enables you to orient your marketing outreach toward thought leaders who
can effectively communicate the value of your service or solution.
