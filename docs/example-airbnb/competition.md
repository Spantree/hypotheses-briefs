# Competition Hypotheses

The landscape of short-term rental accommodations is marked by a diverse range
of service providers, none of which dominate with a complete peer-to-peer model
that we are introducing to the market.

1. In the short-term rental market, there is no single company with a monopoly;
   several key players share the market, each with a significant share.
2. Competitors have defined the basis of competition on a blend of product
   attributes and service quality including convenience, price, location, and
   user experience.
3. Competitors tout features like user-friendly platforms, diverse listings, and
   security measures as their unique selling propositions.
4. Our company and product are distinct in their deep integration of local
   experiences and emphasis on a community-driven, sustainable approach to
   travel.
5. Our service allows customers to not just book a place to stay, but to also
   seamlessly access local culture and activities, enhancing the overall travel
   experience.
6. Our product's better features include a powerful recommendation engine,
   community engagement, and a platform that actively encourages and facilitates
   local tourism and cultural exchange.
7. Close competitors today include Booking.com, Kayak, and traditional hotels.
   We differ in community engagement, personalized local experiences, and
   sustainable travel focus.
8. Currently, customers seeking similar experiences might use a combination of
   booking platforms, travel agencies, and local tour operators.
9. What we admire about competitors like traditional hotels is their ability to
   provide consistent, often high-quality service.
10. Customers appreciate the reliability and user-centric functionality offered
    by existing platforms.
11. A change we would implement is fostering a stronger sense of community and
    personalization within the travel accommodation sector.
12. Competitive products are used for accommodation, booking, and sometimes
    basic travel planning.
13. A significant portion of time is spent on these platforms browsing, booking,
    and planning stays.
14. While not mission critical, finding accommodation is a key component of
    travel planning and has the potential to significantly shape the travel
    experience.
15. Before our product's entry into the market, users would have to plan
    accommodation and local experiences separately, often missing out on the
    level of integration we offer.
16. Without our product, many travelers default to staying at standard
    accommodations and might experience local culture in a fragmented or
    superficial manner.

Our market doesn’t yet exist in the sense that there isn’t a current single
solution that combines both lodging and deep, local cultural exchange in one
user-friendly platform. We fill this gap by offering an intertwined experience
that raises the intrinsic value of travel through personal connections and
authentic local experiences, differentiating us from the competition.
