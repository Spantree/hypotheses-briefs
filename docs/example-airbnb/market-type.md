# Market Type Hypotheses

Airbnb is essentially resegmenting the existing market of short-term
accommodation by focusing on a unique niche: peer-to-peer home-sharing that
offers authentic local experiences, unlike traditional hotels or other
short-term lodging options.

## Entering an Existing Market

1. The competitors in the market include traditional hotel chains, bed and
   breakfast establishments, and existing online platforms like Booking.com and
   Couchsurfing.
2. Market share varies but these models could gain significant traction,
   particularly among millennials and tech-savvy travelers.
3. Competitors' marketing and sales spend is substantial as they strive to
   maintain market dominance through brand loyalty and recognition.
4. Entry against incumbents requires strategic positioning and leveraging our
   unique value proposition. Performance attributes customers value include
   convenience, pricing, authenticity of experience, and customer service.
5. Competitors define performance primarily in terms of occupancy rates,
   customer satisfaction, and profitability.
6. We aim to capture 5% of the market share in the first year, with incremental
   growth to 15% by the end of year three.
7. Our approach is to extend and enhance existing standards by integrating
   deeper local experiences and sustainable travel practices into our service.

## Resegmenting an Existing Market

As pioneers in the market of personal space rental for travelers, Airbnb is
creating a unique niche. The financial crisis has shifted consumer behavior
towards looking for more budget-friendly alternatives to hotels, while hosts are
seeking ways to supplement their income. Our market education revolves around
showcasing the mutual benefits of the platform and how personal and unique
experiences can redefine travel.

1. Customers are coming from the traditional hospitality market and existing
   short-term rental market, seeking more personalized travel experiences.
2. Unique characteristics include a desire for local immersion, authentic
   experiences, and sustainable travel options.
3. Unmet needs include comprehensive local experience offerings, flexible
   accommodation options for various budgets and tastes, and a platform that
   strongly emphasizes community and sustainable practices.
4. Our compelling features such as localized experiences, personalized
   recommendations, and a community-driven approach will attract customers.
5. Existing suppliers may lack the agility to pivot towards highly localized and
   personalized service offerings due to their size and established business
   models.
6. Educating the market and growing to sufficient size may take 1-2 years, with
   targeted marketing and community-building efforts.
7. The market of travelers prioritizing experiences over mere accommodation is
   substantial and growing.
8. Education will be through content marketing, partnerships with local tourism
   boards, and leveraging influencer networks.
9. Demand will be created through innovative social media campaigns,
   storytelling, and showcasing user experiences.
10. Sales forecasts for the first three years include a steady increase as
    market awareness grows, targeting $50 million in bookings by the end of year
    three.

## Entering A New Market

1. While we are not creating a new market, we are significantly enhancing the
   market for facilitated local travel experiences combined with accommodation.
2. The compelling need is for richer travel experiences that offer more than
   just a place to stay but also a way to connect with the culture and
   community.
3. Our platform's combination of unique accommodation options and integrated
   local experiences serves this need.
4. The education and market growth phase is projected to take about 1-2 years,
   heavily reliant on social proof and shared guest/host stories.
5. The size of the enhanced market consists of a substantial segment of
   travelers and hosts disillusioned with traditional hospitality services.
6. Market education will occur through travel events, online communities, and
   collaboration with travel enthusiasts and experts.
7. Demand will be created through exposure to compelling user-generated content,
   testimonials, and showcasing the depth of our experiences.
8. For years one through three, the company expects to see a gradual increase in
   sales volume as the brand gains recognition and trust.
9. Initial financing will focus on marketing, platform development, and creating
   a solid base of hosts and travelers, with break-even anticipated by the end
   of year three.
10. Establishment of a distinctive brand and a loyal community will serve as a
    buffer against competitors attempting to mimic the model.
11. Our approach distinctly re-segments the market by combining and enhancing
    features from typical short-term rental services and enriching them with a
    deep focus on localized experiences.
