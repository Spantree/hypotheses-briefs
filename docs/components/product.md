# Product Hypotheses

## Features

One- or two-sentence summaries of the top ten (or fewer) features of the
product.

## Benefits

The benefits list succinctly describes what benefits the product will deliver to
customers (something new? Something better? Faster? Cheaper?) These
engineering-driven benefits represent hypotheses you will test against real
customer opinions.

## Intellectual Property

A concise summary of assumptions and questions about intellectual property (IP).

1. Are you inventing anything unique?
1. Is any of your IP patentable?
1. Are there trade secrets you need to protect?
1. Have you checked to see whether you infringe on other IP?
1. Do you need to license other patents?

## Dependency Analysis

For us to be successful (that is, to sell our product in volume), hereâ€™s what
has to happen that is out of our control: it may include other technology
infrastructure that needs to emerge, changes in consumer lifestyles or buying
behavior, new laws, changes in economic conditions, and so on. Also write down
how you can measure whether each external change is happening when you need it
to.

## Product Delivery Schedule

Not only the date of the first customer shipment, but the delivery and feature
schedule for follow-on products or multiple releases of the product as far out
as the team can see (up to 18 months). The customer development team will be out
trying to convince a small group of early customers to buy based on the product
specifications, long before you can physically deliver the product. To do that
they will need to paint a picture of what the product will ultimately look like
several releases into the future. This first pass at a schedule is not set in
stone. It will be used to test customer reactions, but not to make commitments.

## Total Cost Ownership/Adoption

Estimate the total cost to customers of buying and using your product.

1. Do they need new computers? Training? Physical or organizational changes that
   need to happen first?
1. What will be the cost of deployment?
1. Do they need to change any part of their current purchasing or usage
   behavior?
1. Do they need to throw away or obsolete something they use today?
