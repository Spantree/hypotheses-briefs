## Customer Problems

### Active Need

1. Travelers actively seek unique, affordable lodging alternatives to expensive or generic hotels.
1. Hosts want a safe, reliable way to earn extra income from their available space but aren't sure how to market or manage it.

### Mission Critical vs. Nice-to-Have

1. For travelers, unique lodging can significantly enhance the travel experience, but it isn't always mission-critical.
1. For hosts, the additional income can be essential, especially in tourist-heavy locations or for hosts relying on it as a primary income source.

### A Day In The Life

1. Travel influencers and travel agents can influence potential travelers' decisions, directing them towards Airbnb listings.
1. Corporate travel managers influence the decisions of business travelers and may establish preferred relationships with platforms like Airbnb.

## ROI (Return On Investment) Justification
