# Distribution and Pricing Hypotheses

Airbnbâ€™s initial distribution channel is a direct-to-consumer online platform,
tapping into the increasing trend of consumers seeking travel arrangements via
the internet. Evolving since 2008, pricing is initially simplistic, with hosts
setting nightly rates and Airbnb taking a commission on each booking, testing
what rates the early market will bear. The lifetime value of a customer is
estimated based on repeat bookings and referrals, both of which are critical in
the early growth phase.

## Creating Customer Demand

Early demand is generated through grassroots efforts, leveraging the founders'
personal networks, offline events, and maximizing emerging social media
platforms to spread the word. Initial marketing strategies focus on story-driven
content, word-of-mouth, and the inherent viral features of the booking and
review process.

   network opportunities.

    and encourage repeat bookings.

## Price Sensitivity

At this stage, customer sensitivity to price is crucial as Airbnb competes with
established accommodation alternatives. The economic climate of 2008 means
travelers are looking for cost-effective options, making Airbnb's affordable and
diverse listings particularly appealing.

Awareness of price sensitivity informs the initial pricing model, accommodating
a spectrum of travelers, from those hit hardest by the economic downturn seeking
budget stays to those who are unaffected and desiring unique travel experiences.

1. Price sensitivity varies across demographics, with budget travelers more
   price-conscious than luxury seekers.
2. A moderate change in pricing can significantly affect booking volumes,
   especially during non-peak seasons.
3. Specific price points can greatly influence demand; for instance, breaking
   the psychological barrier of $100 per night.
4. Economic conditions can lead to increased price sensitivity, requiring more
   competitive pricing or value-added offerings.
5. Industry trends suggest a shift toward value for experience, reducing the
   impact of minor price changes.
6. Despite the availability of substitute accommodations, our unique offerings
   can justify a less elastic pricing model.
7. Our marketing emphasizes the unique experiences and community aspects that
   cannot be replicated by traditional hotels.
8. Strong brand identity and customer satisfaction may lead to a lower price
   sensitivity.
9. An established brand allows for a moderate price premium and customer
   retention despite increasing competition.
10. Barriers such as platform familiarity and trust are offset by user-friendly
    design and community support to encourage switching.
11. Switching costs are minimized by making the transition as seamless as
    possible for new hosts and travelers.
