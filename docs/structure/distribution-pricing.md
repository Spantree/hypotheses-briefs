# Distribution and Pricing Hypotheses

Put a first stake in the ground describing what distribution channel you intend
to use to reach customers (direct, online, telemarketing, reps, retail, etc.).
Take a first guess at pricing. Describe the lifetime value of a customer: how
much can you sell to a customer over the life of the sales relationship?

## Demand Creation

Document how your customers learn about new companies and new products.

## Creating Customer Demand

You need to create demand for your product. Once you create this demand you need
to drive those customers into the sales channel that carries your product.

How will you create demand to drive them into the channel you have chosen, e.g.
advertising, public relations, retail store promotions, PPC, spam, word of
mouth, seminars, telemarketing, partners?

## How Customers Hear About You

1. Do they go to trade shows?
1. What books/magazines/websites do they read or visit?
1. Which ones do they trust?
1. What do their bosses read?
1. Who are the best salespeople they know?
1. Who would they hire to call on them?

## Influencers

In every market or industry there is a select group of individuals who pioneer
the trends, style and opinions.

Who are the influencers who can affect your customers' opinions, e.g. analysts,
members of the press, visionaries. This list will also become your roadmap for
assembling an advisory board.

## Pricing Model

Before setting a pricing strategy, it's essential to hypothesize about the model
that will fit both the company's goals and the market environment.

1. How will we determine the value our product offers to the customers relative
   to alternatives?
1. What is the maximum amount customers are willing to pay for the benefits
   received from our product?
1. Have we estimated all the costs involved in delivering our product to the
   customer, including production, distribution, and overhead?
1. What is the markup percentage we will apply to our costs to ensure
   profitability?
1. Is our cost structure competitive within the market?
1. How does our pricing compare to our main competitors?
1. Will we position our product as a premium or budget option in comparison to
   the competition?
1. Do we have a competitive advantage that allows for a higher or lower pricing
   structure?
1. Are we considering an introductory low price to gain market share quickly?
1. How long will we maintain this lower pricing, and what is the strategy to
   increase it over time?
1. What are the potential risks and benefits of this strategy in terms of
   branding and customer perception?
1. Is our product innovative or unique enough to warrant a high initial price
   that is expected to decrease over time?
1. How will the pricing decrease as the market becomes more saturated or as
   competitors emerge?
1. Are we considering recurring revenue models such as subscriptions or service
   fees?
1. How will we demonstrate continuous value to justify ongoing payments from
   customers?
1. Will prices fluctuate based on demand, inventory, or other market conditions?
1. How transparent will we be about this pricing model with our customers?
1. Are we considering the psychological factors in pricing, such as using charm
   pricing (prices ending in .99) to make products appear less expensive?
1. What psychological triggers relevant to our product can influence the pricing
   decision?

## Price Sensitivity

Understanding how sensitive customers are to price changes can help tailor the
pricing strategy effectively.

1. What demographic factors (age, income, occupation) influence price
   sensitivity for our target market?
1. How do we expect sales volume to respond to changes in price?
1. Are there price points at which a small increase can significantly impact
   demand or a small decrease can significantly increase demand?
1. How does the current economic climate affect our customer's willingness to
   pay for our product?
1. Are there industry or broader economic trends that suggest where price
   sensitivity may be increasing or decreasing?
1. How readily available are substitute goods or services, and how do they
   influence our pricing power?
1. If there are many substitutes, how does this affect our productâ€™s price
   elasticity?
1. Do our unique features or benefits reduce price sensitivity because customers
   cannot easily find similar offerings elsewhere?
1. How do we communicate the unique value proposition to ensure customers
   understand the justification behind our pricing?
1. How does our brand strength and customer loyalty affect price sensitivity?
1. Do we have enough brand equity to command higher prices without significant
   pushback from customers?
1. What are the barriers for a customer to switch from their current solution to
   our product (e.g., contract terms, time investment, learning curve)?
1. How can we leverage or reduce switching costs to minimize price sensitivity?
