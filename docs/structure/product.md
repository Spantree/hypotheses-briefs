# Product Hypotheses

The product hypotheses section distills critical assumptions about the tangible
and intangible attributes of a product. It facilitates meticulous forecasting of
how the product should look, feel, and function, and how it resonates with
potential customers.

## Features

Begin with a concise outline of what your product will offer. Translate
technical features into compelling benefits that stand out to customers. Each
feature's description should be a short (one or two sentence) summary that
precisely captures its importance and anticipated appeal. Try to define between
seven and ten features in this section.

## Benefits

List the distinctive benefits that the product will deliver. Whether it's
offering something revolutionary or simply doing things better, faster, or more
cost-effectively, these benefits are what you hypothesize will meet customer
demands. These are the selling points that you will put to the test against what
customers are truly seeking.

What makes your product stand out, and why should your customers care? Explore
the direct advantages your product promises to deliver, and predict how it will
enhance the customer experience. Craft questions that challenge your team to dig
deep and justify each assumed benefit:

1. What specific problem does each product feature solve for the customer?
1. How do these benefits improve upon current solutions or market offerings?
1. In what ways will the product save time, reduce costs, or improve efficiency
   for the user?
1. What are the potential increases in productivity or revenue that your product
   could enable?
1. How will the product enhance the user experience or customer satisfaction?
1. Is there an environmental, social, or ethical benefit your product provides?
1. Can any of the benefits lead to a paradigm shift in the way customers operate
   in their personal or professional lives?
1. How might these benefits evolve or scale with future versions or updates of
   the product?

## Intellectual Property

Intellectual Property (IP) is fundamental in safeguarding and capitalizing on
your productâ€™s innovations. This section prompts you to carefully consider what
elements of your product might warrant legal protection or require careful
navigation of existing patents.

1. What unique creation, invention, or innovation does our product include that
   may be eligible for intellectual property protection?
1. Based on a preliminary assessment, which aspects of our IP have the potential
   to be patented, and what is the strategic value of acquiring such patents?
1. Have we identified any trade secrets within our processes or technology that
   are integral to our competitive advantage and need to be safeguarded?
1. What steps have been taken to review existing IP in the market to ensure our
   product does not infringe on the rights of others?
1. In the case of potential IP infringement, how prepared are we to engage in
   licensing agreements or make necessary design alterations?
1. How do we plan to monitor and enforce our intellectual property rights, and
   are there resources allocated for potential IP litigation?
1. What is the plan for maintaining the confidentiality of IP-related
   information, especially during the early stages of product development and
   when engaging with external parties?
1. Should we open source parts of our technology, and what strategic benefits or
   risks does this pose for innovation, community building, and our economic
   model?
1. How will open sourcing impact our company's revenue and long-term growth, and
   what steps can we take to secure the integrity and value of our proprietary
   features?

## Dependency Analysis

Understanding external factors that can impact your product's success is just as
crucial as the product details themselves. Analyze the circumstances and changes
outside of your control that may influence market acceptance and sales. Define
how you plan to track these changes and what metrics will signify their
influence on your product strategy.

1. Which technology trends or emerging standards might affect the relevance of
   the product?
1. How do changes in regulatory policies or international trade laws impact
   product distribution or functionality?
1. What consumer behavior trends could influence the adoption of your product?
1. Are there any political or policy changes that could alter your product's
   marketability?
1. How might shifts in economic conditions, such as inflation rates or currency
   fluctuations, affect product pricing and customer purchasing power?
1. In what ways could advancements in complementary technologies boost your
   product's utility or desirability?
1. What industry-specific risks, such as supply chain disruptions or competitive
   innovations, must be navigated?
1. Which partnerships or alliances are crucial for the product's integration
   into broader ecosystems or platforms?

## Product Delivery Schedule

Beyond the initial launch, strategize the rollout of your product's subsequent
versions or features. Assess and map out a timeline that encompasses the
product's evolution in the short and medium term. This flexible roadmap is a
tool for dialogue with early customers and not a set of concrete promises.

This is more than just the delivery date of the first customer shipment, but the
delivery and feature schedule for follow-on products or multiple releases of the
product as far out as the team can see (up to 18 months). The customer
development team will be out trying to convince a small group of early customers
to buy based on the product specifications, long before you can physically
deliver the product.

1. What is the projected date for the initial product launch, and how was this
   date determined?
1. What key milestones must be achieved leading up to the launch, and what are
   their deadlines?
1. How have customer feedback and testing influenced the development timeline
   and feature prioritization?
1. What are the risks that could delay the product delivery, and how can these
   be mitigated?
1. How does the delivery schedule align with key sales and marketing
   initiatives?
1. What resources (team, budget, technology) are necessary to stay on track with
   the delivery schedule?
1. How will the success of each product release be measured, and what criteria
   will determine if 1. adjustments to the schedule are needed?
1. After the initial release, what is the timeline for subsequent feature
   rollouts, updates, or iterations?

## Total Cost Ownership/Adoption

Estimate the comprehensive cost for customers when adopting your product. This
estimation encompasses not only the price of the product itself but also
auxiliary costs such as training, systemic changes, and the phase-out of current
solutions. Reflect on every aspect that wi

1. Do they need new equipment? Training? Physical or organizational changes that
   need to happen first?
1. What will be the cost of deployment?
1. Do they need to change any part of their current purchasing or usage
   behavior?
1. Do they need to throw away or obsolete something they use today?
