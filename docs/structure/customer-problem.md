# Customer and Problem Hypotheses

This crucial exploration sets the stage for innovation by mapping out who will
benefit from the new developments and the specific challenges they face. This
understanding is at the heart of both product design and service delivery.

## Types Of Customers

Recognizing the diversity of customers provides vital clues to developing
offerings that cater to different needs and decision drivers. It is essential to
define clearly how various groups will interact with and benefit from the
offering.

1. Who are the end-users and how do their needs differ from those of the buyers
   or decision-makers?
1. What specific problems do influencers, recommenders, and decision-makers seek
   to solve with your offering?
1. Are there groups, like support staff or partners, who interact with it
   differently?
1. In what ways do economic buyers assess the value of your offering compared to
   daily users?
1. How do the priorities and challenges vary among different customer groups?
1. Are there individuals who could resist or impede the adoption process?
1. What data or assistance does each group need to make an informed choice?
1. How might variables like industry trends or locale impact customer needs and
   behaviors?

## Customer Problems

Identifying customer challenges is key to delivering meaningful value. It
includes evaluating the tangible and latent difficulties they confront, which
informs the urgency and focus of the response.

### Latent Need

These are the challenges that customers may not fully recognize or deem
important yet. Such unrecognized needs can represent untapped opportunities,
ripe for innovative offerings.

1. What workarounds are currently being used by customers that might signal an
   underlying challenge?
1. What recurring pain points or frustrations hint at deeper issues?
1. Are there industry shifts or emerging technologies indicating new customer
   needs?
1. What prevailing customer assumptions about their current offerings could be
   addressed or improved upon?
1. What advancing technologies might unveil needs that are not on customers'
   radar?

### Active Need

Here, focus on the pain points customers are acutely aware of and urgently need
to address. Defining these helps to prioritize and tailor offerings that fulfill
their immediate requirements.

1. How are customers trying to address their needs, and what alternatives are
   they considering?
1. What is the urgency of solving these problems, and what would be the
   repercussions of no solution?
1. What efforts or sacrifices are customers prepared to make to find a remedy
   for their problems?

By addressing these areas, organizations can ensure their products and services
are precisely matched to real and perceived customer needs.

## A Day In The Life

Gaining a nuanced view of the customer's everyday environment provides rich
insights into how the offerings provided can be integrated into workflows and
systems, streamlining their day-to-day operations and supporting their strategic
goals.

1. How do customers' daily activities interface with the product or service?
1. Are there existing tools or systems that you would need to complement or
   replace?
1. How would the adoption alter their typical day, workflows, or system use?

## Organizational and Customer Influence Map

Identifying key stakeholders and the influential web within organizations
clarifies who will weigh in on purchasing decisions. Recognizing these
relationships is crucial for crafting persuasive communication.

1. Which individuals have the final say, and how does their influence filter
   through the organization?
1. How do you envision a sale unfolding?
1. What sequence of approvals is needed, and who needs convincing?
1. Can you spot potential advocates who will champion the value of your
   offering?
1. What credible sources might influence their thinking?

## ROI (Return On Investment) Justification

Clearly stating the potential gains from the investment in your offering helps
justify its adoption. It's about identifying the benefits whether they are more
straightforward, like cost savings, or more intangible, such as reputation
enhancement.

1. What measurable advantages can customers expect from adopting your
   deliverables?
1. What is the predicted timeline for realizing these benefits?
1. How does your offering stack up against others in delivering ROI?

## Minimum Feature Set

Pinpointing the most fundamental aspects necessary to address the identified
customer problems without extraneous complexity is essential. This focus helps
to prioritize the features or service elements that are most critical at launch.

1. Which core features or service elements are customers willing to pay for
   initially?
1. How does each identified feature or service aspect address the primary
   customer challenges?
1. What future enhancements might customers find valuable, and how should they
   be introduced?

This structured approach to customer and problem hypotheses aligns the
development of both products and services with market requirements. It ensures
that what's brought to market is both relevant and positioned to effectively
meet customer expectations and industry needs.
