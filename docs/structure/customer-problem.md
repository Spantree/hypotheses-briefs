# Customer and Problem Hypotheses

## Types Of Customers

Are there different types of customers we should approach when we sell our
product (End Users, Influencers, Recommenders, Economic Buyers, Decision
Makers)? In addition to all these parties to the sale there’s one more group
that needs to be mentioned. You won’t be looking for them, but they will see you
coming. In the case of sales to companies, document titles and where in the
organization they are to be found.

## Customer Problems

Understand how customers experience pain (their problem) and why (how much) it
matters to them. Summarize not only what the customer's problem, but what the
organizational impact of the problem is in terms of the different types of pain
it causes at various levels of the company/family/consumer. Capture answers to
the question “If they could wave a magic wand and change anything at all, what
would it be?” Categorize problems as follows:

### Latent Need

The customers have a problem or they have a problem and understand that they
have a problem.

### Active Need

The customers recognize a problem -- they are in pain -- and are actively
searching for a solution, but haven’t done any serious work to solve it yet.
They have a vision: they have an idea of what a solution to the problem would
look like, may have cobbled together a homegrown solution, and, in the best
case, are prepared to pay for a better solution.

1. Are you solving a Mission Critical problem?
1. Is the solution only nice-to-have?

## A Day In The Life

This requires a deep understanding of a target company on many levels. Document
how the world looks from an end-user perspective:

1. How does an end user spend their day?
1. What products do they use and for how long?
1. How would their life change if they started using your product?
1. What about their manager?
1. What about the president or executives of the company?
1. What about the IT department? What other systems do they support?

## Organizational and Customer Influence Map

Most customers don’t work by themselves. They interact with other people. List
all of the people you believe could influence a customer’s buying decisions. If
you’re targeting large companies, you might have a lot of complexity and
unknowns in your diagram. Document the relationships between the Recommenders,
Influencers, Economic Buyers, Decision Makers and Saboteurs.

1. How do you think a sale will be made?
1. Who has to be convinced and in what order?

## ROI (Return On Investment) Justification

What is the customer’s expectation from their investment measured against goals
such as time, money, resources and status?

## Minimum Feature Set

1. What is the smallest set of features that customers will pay for in the first
   release?
1. What is the smallest or least complicated problem that the customer will help
   us solve?
