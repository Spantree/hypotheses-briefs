# Competition Hypotheses

If you are creating a new market, assume that the surrounding markets and
companies will ultimately move into your market.

1. Is there no single dominant company (less than 30% market share)? If a
   monopoly exists with over 80% of the market your only hope is to re-segment.
1. How have existing competitors defined the basis of competition?
1. Is it on product attributes? Service?
1. What are their claims? Features?
1. Why do you believe your company and product are different?
1. Does it allow customers to do something they couldn’t do before?
1. If so, what makes you think they will care?
1. Does your product have better features? Performance? Channel? Price?
1. Who are your closest competitors today? In features? Performance? Price?
1. If there is no direct competitor, who does the customer go to today to get
   the equivalent of what you offer?
1. What do you like most about each of your competitors' product?
1. What do your customers like most?
1. If you could change one thing, what would it be?
1. How do competitive products get used?
1. What percentage of end user’s time is spent using it?
1. How mission critical is it?
1. If your market doesn’t yet exist, how do users get by without your product
   today?
1. Do they simply not do something or do it badly?
