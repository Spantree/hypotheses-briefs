# Market Type Hypotheses

Is your company entering an existing market, resegmenting an existing market or
creating a new market?

## Entering an Existing Market

1. Who are the competitors and who is driving the market?
1. What is the market share of each of the competitors?
1. What is the total marketing and sales dollars the market share leaders will
   be spending to compete with you?
1. Do you understand the cost of entry against incumbents?
1. What performance attributes have customers told you are important?
1. How do competitors define performance?
1. What percentage of this market do you want to capture in years one through
   three?
1. Do you want your company to embrace these standards, extend them, or replace
   them?

## Resegmenting an Existing Market

Your positioning will rest on being 1) lower cost or 2) finding a unique niche
offering.

1. What existing markets are your customers coming from?
1. What are the unique characteristics of those customers? # What compelling
   needs of those customers are unmet by existing suppliers?
1. What compelling features of your product will get customers of existing
   companies to abandon their current supplier?
1. Why couldn’t existing companies offer the same thing?
1. How long will it take you to educate potential customers and to grow a market
   of sufficient size?
1. What size is that?
1. How will you educate the market?
1. How will you create demand?
1. Given no customers exist for your market segment, what are realistic year one
   through three sales forecasts?

## Entering A New Market

1. What market will potential customers come from?
1. What compelling need will make customers use/buy your product?
1. What compelling feature will make them buy/use your product?
1. How long will it take you to educate potential customers and to grow a market
   of sufficient size?
1. What size is that?
1. How will you educate the market?
1. How will you create demand?
1. Given no customers exist yet, what are realistic year one through three sales
   forecasts?

   entering an existing one?
